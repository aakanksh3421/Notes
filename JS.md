## NOTE 
1. **Check if the Linked List is Empty:**
    
    - If `start_pos` is `NULL`, this means the linked list is empty.
    - In this case, a new node is created using `createNode()`, and the new element is inserted as the first element in the data array.
    - Both `start_pos` and `end_pos` are updated to point to this new node.
2. **Check if there is Space in the Current Node:**
    
    - If the current node (`*end_pos`) has space for more elements (`(*end_pos)->numElements < NODE_SIZE`), the new element is inserted into the current node's data array, and the `numElements` count is incremented.
3. **Create a New Node if the Current Node is Full:**
    
    - If the current node is full, a new node (`new_node`) is created using `createNode()`.
4. **Move Elements to the New Node:**
    
    - The function determines the midpoint (`mid`) of the elements in the current node.
    - It moves the elements from the midpoint to the end of the current node's data array to the data array of the new node.
5. **Update `end_pos` and `numElements`:**
    
    - The `numElements` count of the current node is adjusted to be the midpoint.
    - The `next` pointer of the current node is set to point to the new node.
    - `end_pos` is updated to point to the new node.
6. **Insert the New Element into the New Node:**
    
    - The new element is inserted into the new node's data array.
    - The `numElements` count of the new node is incremented.
